			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>The hydraulic configuration is the definition of all the controls that govern the physical stage-discharge 
			relationship, and their succession/combination when the water level rises. 
			It plays a crucial role in an analysis with BaRatinAGE because
			it induces the equation of the rating curve.</p>
			<p>Specifying a hydraulic configuration must result from a hydraulic analysis of how 
			the hydrometric station works. For a natural river, the following situation is quite frequent: 
			at low flows, the stage-discharge relationship is controlled by the geometry of a critical section at one 
			or more weirs/sills (natural or artificial). When the stage 
			increases, the weir gets drowned and the stage-discharge relationship is then controlled by the average geometry 
			and roughness of the low-flow channel. 
			For an even larger stage, part of the stream may flow in a floodway 
			or over the bars of the main channel:
			the stage-discharge relationship is then controlled by two channels: the low-flow channel and the floodway.</p>
			<p>BaRatinAGE formalises this hydraulic analysis for a wide variety of situations, which covers
			the vast majority of practical cases encountered in natural rivers (while making some 
			acceptable approximations). The recommended practice in BaRatinAGE is to break down the real critical sections 
			into a combination of idealised weirs or orifices, and the real controlling channels in a combination of wide, rectangular channels. 
			Each introduced control must correspond to physical elements that can be clearly identified in the field.
			For details on the hydraulic analysis of a hydrometric station, you may refer to 
			<a href="img/HydraulicAnalysis.pdf">this document</a>.</p>
			
			<h1>Creating a hydraulic configuration</h1>
			<p>You can create a new hydraulic configuration in several ways:
				<ul>
					<li>via the Hydraulic configuration...Add menu;</li> 
					<li>via the Ctrl+C shortcut;</li> 
					<li>by making a right click on the node "Hydraulic configuration" in the xplorer tree;</li> 
					<li>by clicking the button  
					<img src="img/Hydraulic_icon.png",alt="Hydraulic_icon",id="Hydraulic_icon", align="middle"> 
					in the tool bar.</li> 
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>You will be asked to name this new hydraulic configuration, and you can enter a description.
			In the "Hydraulic configuration" tab,
			you need to specify the properties of this configuration. If you wish, you can enter a
			free text in the "Description" field. You must also specify the number of controls that make up this
			configuration. As an illustration, we will work with the common example mentioned above, 
			and thus select 3 controls (weir, low-flow channel, floodway).</p> 
			<p>The panels of the "Hydraulic configuration" tab then update. In particular,
			the following matrix, called "matrix of controls" or "Bonnifait matrix" (in honor of his
			venerable inventor) appears:</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="img/Matrix_diag.png",alt="ControlMatrix",id="ControlMatrix"></p>
			<p>This matrix determines how controls succeed or add to each other. 
			Each row of the matrix corresponds to a stage segment, and each column to a control.
			The above matrix is therefore interpreted as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>In segment 1 (the lowest stages, i.e. low flows), only control 1 (the weir) is activated;</li> 
					<li>In segment 2 (intermediate stages), only control 2 (the low-flow channel) is activated;</li>
					<li>In segment 3 (the highest stages, i.e. high flows), only control 3 (the floodway) is activated.</li> 
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>This matrix is not adequate for the example here. Indeed, for the third segment, the flow is both 
			in the low-flow channel and in the floodway. The control by the floodway should therefore be added to the control by 
			the low-flow channel (instead of replacing it). We can specify this combination of controls by selecting, for the 
			third segment, both control 2 ("low-flow channel") and control 3 ("floodway") as shown below:</p>	
			<p align="center"><img src="img/Matrix_ok.png",alt="ControlMatrix",id="ControlMatrix"></p>
			<p>Note 1: Remember to click the "Apply" button to save the edits that you have made.</p>
			<p>Note 2: There are some restrictions on how to fill the matrix of controls (e.g., a control 
			that has been disabled cannot be re-enabled in a higher segment, etc.), which is why all 
			the matrix cells are not clickable.</p>
			<p>Note 3: The information contained in the matrix of controls is sufficient to write the equation of the rating curve. 
			For more details on this equation, you can refer to <a href="img/RCequation.pdf">this document</a>.
			</p>

			<h1>Defining the hydraulic controls</h1>
			<p>The hydraulic analysis not only identifies the different types of controls that govern the 
			stage-discharge relationship, and their succession/combination: it also allows a first quantitative 
			(though potentially very uncertain) estimation of the rating curve.</p>
			<p>In BaRatinAGE, each control is associated with a stage (H) - discharge (Q) relationship 
			in the form of the basic equation:</p>
			<p>Q = a(H-b)<sup>c</sup> for H > k (and Q = 0 if H &#8804 b)
				<ul>			
					<li>k is the activation stage; when the stage falls below the k value, the control becomes inactive;</li>
					<li>a is the coefficient, which depends on the physical properties of the control;</li>
					<li>c is the exponent, which depends only on the type of control;</li>
					<li>b is the offset; when the stage falls below the value b, the flow is zero. Note that this parameter 
				is generally different from the activation stage k. For example, for a channel control that takes over 
				a weir control, the parameter b represents the average elevation of the channel bottom, but the control only 
				activates when the weir is drowned, at a stage which is different from b.</li>
				</ul>
			Each of these parameters can be related to the physical characteristics of the control as explained 
			 in detail in <a href="img/HydraulicControls.zip">this document</a>. It is therefore possible to define approximate 
			 values for each parameter, and most importantly their (potentially large) uncertainty. 
			 We say we thus define <em>prior parameters</em>, the term <em>prior</em> being used here to 
			 mean that this first rough estimation can and <strong>must</strong> be done without using any gauging.
			 Finally, note that in practice the definition of priors is done only for the parameters 
			 k, a and c. Indeed, the continuity of the rating curve is a constraint which implies that the parameter b
			 is automatically deduced from the other three parameters.</p>
			
			<p>Defining prior parameters is done in the lower part of the descriptive panel, 
			where each control is associated with a tab. Getting back to the example used so far, we can
			define the characteristics of the first control by entering a description of the control and 
			by selecting its type in the pulldown menu (here "rectangular weir"). This selection 
			provides access to the <em>prior assistant</em> that will help you relate the physical properties of
			the control and the uncertain values of the parameters k, a and c. By clicking the button, the assistant 
			opens in a new window like the one shown below. In the upper part of the window, 
			the relationship between the physical properties of the control and the parameters k, a and c are recalled
			(obviously these relationships depend on the previously selected control type). You can 
			enter the physical properties in the fields located in the left side of the window 
			(some fields are prefilled because they only depend on the type of control, but you can always
			edit them if you wish). Note that everywhere throughout BaRatinAGE, uncertainties are expressed 
			as 95% expanded uncertainties, i.e. as the half-width of a 95% confidence interval. 
			For a Gaussian distribution, this corresponds to 1.96 times the standard deviation.
			Once all fields are defined, a click on the "Compute" button 
			will translate the physical properties of the control in terms of parameters k, a and c, and propagate 
			the uncertainties. Finally, clicking the "apply" button will close the assistant and complete 
			the definition of prior parameters for the first control. You can continue with the second 
			control in a similar manner until all controls are completed.</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="img/PriorAssistant.png",alt="PriorAssistant",id="PriorAssistant"></p>
			
			<h1>The prior rating curve</h1>
			<p> Once the priors are defined for all the controls, it is possible to plot 
			a first rating curve (with uncertainties), called the <em>prior rating curve</em> 
			because it is achieved without using any gauging. The prior rating curve is computed 
			using a Monte Carlo approach: parameters k, a and c of all the controls are sampled randomly 
			using the uncertainties defined in the previous step. By sampling a large number of parameters, 
			we obtain a large number of possible curves which are used to calculate an uncertainty interval 
			at a given confidence level (95% in BaRatinAGE).</p>
			<p>In practice, you must specify the following information at the top of the graphic panel:
				<ul>
					<li>The number of Monte Carlo simulations Nsim. We recommend keeping the default value, 
					i.e. 1000, which is sufficient in practice and requires only limited computation time;</li>
					<li>A grid of stages on which the rating curve is calculated. Defining 
					this grid requires the following information:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The minimum stage of the grid, Hmin;</li>
							<li>The maximum stage of the grid, Hmax;</li>
							<li>The step of the grid, Hstep. We recommend you automatically calculate this step 
							using the size of the default grid (grid of 101 values). Of course you can 
							select the desired number of steps Nstep, or directly set the space step Hstep if you wish,
							but be careful, the computing time is proportional to the size of the grid.</li>
						</ul>		
				</ul>
			Once all the information is entered, you can start the computation by clicking on the "Run" button, and 
			a few seconds later, the prior rating curve should appear in the graphic panel, as shown below. 
			Of course, this prior curve will be generally very uncertain, but we will use the gaugings in the next step 
			to reduce this uncertainty. The graph also shows the activation stages of the 
			various controls as green vertical lines (with uncertainty). 
			This visualisation of the prior curve allows you to check the relevance and consistency 
			of your prior assumptions on the controls.</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="img/PriorRC.png",alt="PriorRatingCurve",id="PriorRatingCurve"></p>
			<p>Here are some important recommendations for defining priors:
				<ul>
					<li>First golden rule: <strong>do not use the gaugings</strong>. These will indeed 
					be used in the next step, and using them also for "tuning" the prior curve 
					would be using the same information twice: this is a guarantee to underestimate uncertainties! 
					Also note that it is not possible to display gaugings in the prior 
					rating curve graph (and it's done on purpose!)</li>
					<li>Second golden rule: <strong>be honest</strong>! You should not hesitate setting 
					a large uncertainty when you do not know much about a parameter. Of course this will result 
					in a very uncertain prior rating curve, but that curve is not the final curve since 
					the information provided by the gaugings will be used in the next step to decrease 
					the uncertainty. Here are some typical examples:
						<ul>
							<li>parameters that are often poorly known a priori: the activation stage of a control when it 
							corresponds to the drowning of a weir; the geometric properties of a natural channel that is 
							not very uniform along the controlling reach; the roughness of a natural channel 
							(Strickler or Manning coefficient), etc.;</li>
							<li>parameters that are often quite well known a priori: the geometric properties of an artificial structure or 
							channel; the exponent c, which depends only on the type of control; discharge coefficients 
							of artificial controlling sections (rectangle, triangle, orifice, etc.), etc .;</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Remember to click the "Apply" button before executing the computation of the prior rating curve 
					to be sure you have saved your latest changes to the hydraulic configuration.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Finally, note that by clicking on the "More plots" button, it is possible to plot the 
			rating curve "spaghettis": in this chart, each curve corresponds to a random sampling 
			of parameters k, a and c of each control, as explained above. Displaying all the Nsim 
			random samples provides a different representation of the uncertainty than the standard 
			interval (Note. only 100 spaghettis are actually plotted for readability and efficiency reasons).</p>
