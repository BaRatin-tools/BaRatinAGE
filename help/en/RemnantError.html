			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>Consider the following situation, which is obviously idealised and unrealistic: 
			at a hydrometric station, we have perfect gaugings (i.e. zero uncertainty), and many of of them.
			Accordingly, it is possible to estimate precisely the parameters of the rating curve, 
			and thus the uncertainty surrounding the rating curve is very low - say it is even negligible for simplicity.
			Nevertheless, we still expect the gaugings do not line up perfectly with the rating curve.
			There is therefore always a scatter of the gaugings around the curve which is due neither
			to uncertainty in gaugings (which is zero), nor to uncertainty in calibration of the rating curve
			(which is negligible).</p>
			<p>More generally, it is frequently observed that the uncertainties of gaugings and the uncertainty
			in estimating the parameters of the curve are not sufficient to explain the scatter of 
			discharge measurements around the curve. It therefore "remains" a source of error, which
			has many possible causes: structural error of the rating curve (because the rating curve equation 
			used is an approximation of the true physical relationship between stage and discharge),
			slight undetected shifts, ignored hysteresis, underestimated gaugings uncertainties, etc.</p>
			<p>To address this problem, BaRatinAGE introduces the concept of <em>remnant error</em>,
			which is used to add the uncertainty lacking to explain the scatter of the gaugings around the rating curve,
			without really assessing the origin of such missing uncertainty.
			This is somehow the uncertainty garbage collector (hence the icon used).</p>
						
			<h1>Models available in BaRatinAGE</h1>
			<p>The remnant error is assumed to be independent accross gaugings, and to follow a 
			Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unknown standard deviation, &#963.
			This standard deviation will be estimated along with the parameters of the rating curve. 
			There are two options for this unknown standard deviation:
				<ul>
					<li>The standard deviation &#963 is constant, so there is a single additional 
					parameter to estimate. Experience shows that this assumption is not very suitable 
					for cases typically encountered in practice. 
					Specifically, it is frequently observed that the standard deviation is larger for high flows.</li>
					<li>To account for this observation, the second option is to assume that 
					the standard deviation &#963 is a linear function of the discharge computed with the rating curve:
					&#963 = g<sub>1</sub>+g<sub>2</sub>*Q. In this case, there are two parameters to be estimated,
					g<sub>1</sub> et g<sub>2</sub>. 
					We recommend using this second option, which generally makes the uncertainty induced
					by the remnant error more realistic over the entire flow range.</li>
					<li>The third option is a purely proportional version of the previous option:
					&#963 = g<sub>2</sub>*Q.</li>
				</ul>
			</p> 
			<p>All three models are already implemented in BaRatinAGE and are not configurable via the interface: 
			no specification is needed to create a remnant error model.
			Later on you will just have to select the model to use for estimating the rating curve.
			A more formal and more complete description of the remnant error models, 
			and more generally of the statistical models used in BaRatinAGE, is available in 
			<a href="img/BaRatinStatisticalModel.pdf">this document</a>.</p>
