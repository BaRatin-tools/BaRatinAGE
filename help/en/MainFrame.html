			<h1>General structure</h1>
			<p>The window shown below appears when BaRatinAGE starts. In addition to the standard menu and tool bars
			(detailed later), this window includes the following main areas:
					<li>On the left, the <em>Xplorer</em> that will allow browsing through the different objects created in BaRatinAGE: hydraulic configuration, gaugings,
 					remnant error, stage series, rating curve and flow series.</li> 
					<li>On the right, the <em>thematic tabs</em> that represent these objects. This area is further divided into two sub-zones:
						<ul>
							<li>On the left, the <em>descriptive panel</em> of the object, which in particular allows specifying its properties;</li>
							<li>On the right, the <em>chart area</em> in which each object is represented by a specific graph.</li>
						</ul>
					</li> 
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>All the fields are empty at the moment, since no object exists in BaRatinAGE when it starts. To illustrate more efficiently
			how BaRatinAGE works, let us open an existing study. To do this, click on the <em>Open</em> tool
				<img src="img/Open.png",alt="Open",id="Open", align="middle"> 
				or on the <em>File...Open</em> menu,
				and open the file named <em>Sauze.bar.zip</em> in the <em>exemple</em> directory (this directory is located in the folder where you installed BaRatinAGE).</p> 
			<p align="center"><img src="img/MainWindow_empty.png",alt="MainWindow_empty",id="MainWindow_empty"></p>

			<h1>Navigation through the Xplorer</h1>
			<p>The main window should now contain multiple objects as shown in the figure below. The rationale of the GUI is 
			to use the Xplorer to navigate within BaRatinAGE. We therefore recommend to click on the Xplorer tree rather than directly on the tabs. 
			Left click allows selecting an object, which automatically updates the corresponding thematic tab. 
			Right click gives access to a number of tools (detailed later).</p>
			<p>Also note that the tooltips are everywhere in the application. Feel free to use them as 
			they often provide more detailed guidance than the names of the fields, buttons, etc.</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="img/MainWindow_full.png",alt="MainWindow_full",id="MainWindow_full"></p>
	
			<h1>Descriptive panel</h1>
			<p>The descriptive panel contains all the information on objects managed in BaRatinAGE 
			(hydraulic configuration, gaugings, remnant error, stage series, rating curve and flow series). 
			The content of this panel is completely object-specific: it will be 
			described in the following pages, which present these objects one by one.</p>

			<h1>Chart area</h1>
			<p>All graphic panels are organised in a similar manner with the following four buttons above the chart area:
				<ul>
					<li>Turn the y-axis to log scale. Warning: negative or zero values are 
					arbitrarily assigned the value 10<sup>-6</sup> in this representation;</li> 
					<li>Copy the plot in an external window. This is especially useful if you want to edit the graph (see below) 
					or compare multiple items of the same type (for example, several rating curves);</li> 
					<li>Display the legend;</li> 
					<li>Create another plot. The list of plots available varies depending on the object, and will be detailed 
					separately for each object.</li> 
				</ul>
			</p>			
			<p>Also note the following features of the chart area itself:
				<ul>
					<li>You can zoom in with the mouse by holding down the left mouse button and drawing a rectangle 
					from the upper left corner to the lower right corner. To return to the original axes, proceed similarly 
					but by drawing the rectangle from the lower right corner to the upper left corner;</li> 
					<li>Right-click in the chart gives access to a fairly complete menu, where the following items are particularly useful:
						<ul>
							<li>copy to clipboard;</li>
							<li>export in image format;</li>
							<li>print;</li>
							<li>edit the graphic properties. We urge to reproduce the figure in an
							external window before editing these properties. Indeed, the main chart area of BaRatinAGE is 
							frequently refreshed, and the edits will be lost after an update of the plot. 
							The graphical properties that can be changed include the titles (of the graph and axes), 
							the font and color of labels, the axis scales, margins, etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li> 
					</ul>
			</p>
 
			<h1>Menus and actions on objects </h1>
			<h2>"File" menu</h2>		
			<p>This menu includes the usual tools to open and save a study, create a new study and quit the application. 
			It is not possible to open more than one study at a time, and the rationale of BaRatinAGE is that a study corresponds to a hydrometric station. 
			For a given study, it is possible to define several hydraulic configurations, several sets of gauging, several rating curves, etc.</p>

			
			<h2>Basic operations on objects</h2>		
			<p>All BaRatinAGE objects can be handled with a few basic actions, which are accessible via the menus or by right-clicking in the tree:
			<ul>
				<li>Add (also accessible via the buttons on the toolbar): creates a new object after naming it. 
				The objects are identified by name in BaRatinAGE: it is therefore not possible to use the same name for two objects of the same type 
				(For example two rating curves, two hydraulic configurations, etc.)</li> 
				<li>Rename: You can rename an existing object;</li> 
				<li>Duplicate: copies the properties of an existing object into a new object (you'll have to name it)</li> 
				<li>Delete: deletes an existing object. Warning: the deletion of an object can cause deleting other objects that depend on it!
				For example, deleting a set of gaugings will also delete all the rating curves that used these gaugings,
				and so it also will also delete all the flow series that used these rating curves!
				A warning message is issued to alert the user about these chain deletions.</li> 
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>For objects <em>rating curve</em> and <em>flow series</em>, there is also an action "Export" to save the results of
			BaRatinAGE computations in various formats.</p>
			<p>For all objects, there is an "Apply" button at the bottom of the descriptive panel which is used to save the edits
			done on the object. We strongly recommend frequently clicking this button, because an edit is not saved as long as
			the "Apply" button is not pressed. You could hence loose your edits if, for example, you leave the tab
			of your object without clicking "Apply".</p>

			<h2>"Options" menu</h2>	
			<p>Use this menu to change the following options:
			<ul>
				<li>Language: Language of BaRatinAGE (available to date: French or English);</li> 
				<li>Preferences: choose between several regional customs 
				(at present: choice between the Strickler or Manning coefficients, coming soon: choosing the system of units, 
				choice between stage-discharge or discharge-stage plots, etc.);</li> 
				<li>Default Directory: sets the default directory that will be proposed for all file operations such as save, export, opening files, etc.
				(by default, this directory is the folder where you installed BaRatinAGE);</li> 
				<li>MCMC Options: Adjust the properties of the MCMC sampler (<a href="img/MCMC.zip">technical details</a>);</li> 
				<li>Save Options: enables or disables the backup of some objects that may be very large. 
				Enabling this backup can generate extremely large files (potentially several Gbytes!) and noticeably slow down 
				the opening and saving actions.</li> 
			</ul>
