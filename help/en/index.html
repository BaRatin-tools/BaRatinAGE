			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>BaRatinAGE is a software for estimating rating curves and their uncertainties, and
			propagate these uncertainties to flow/discharge series. The method is based on the
			<a href="img/HydraulicAnalysis.pdf">hydraulic analysis</a> of the hydrometric station and on the
			<a href="img/BayesianBasics.zip">Bayesian estimation</a> of the rating curve.
			BaRatinAGE stands for BAyesian RATINg curve Advanced Graphical Environment.</p>
			<p>To install BaRatinAGE, simply extract the zip file you downloaded <a href="https://forge.irstea.fr/projects/baratinage_v2/files">here</a>
			into the folder of your choice, <strong>provided you have write access to this folder</strong>. Double-click the <strong>BaRatinAGE.jar</strong> file
			and (hopefully...) it should be ready to go!</p>
			<p>Note 1: BaRatinAGE being a Java application, it requires a Java Virtual Machine installed on your computer. On the vast majority of computers,
			it should already be the case. Otherwise, you can download or update Java <a href="https://www.java.com/fr/download/">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Note 2:  On Windows, the association between Java and .jar files is sometimes broken. You may try to fix this association (some hints <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1285282/how-to-repair-a-broken-jar-association-in-windows-10"> here</a>), or alternatively you may use <a href="img/ClickMe.bat"> this file</a> to start BaRatinAGE (open it with a text editor, modify the path to Java, save/close then double-click on the file).</p>
			<p>Note 3: the default language when BaRatinAGE is launched first is French. You can change the language via the Options...Language menu.</p>

			<h1>Main objects in BaRatinAGE</h1>
			<p>BaRatinAGE manipulates the following objects (which will be further detailed in the following pages):
				<ul>
					<li>The <em>hydraulic configuration</em> is the definition of all the controls that govern the physical stage-discharge relationship, and their
						succession/combination when the water level rises. The hydraulic configuration induces the equation of the rating curve.</li>
					<li>The <em>set of gaugings</em> is the set of discrete measurements of stage and discharge that will be used to estimate the parameters of the
						rating curve.</li>
					<li>The <em>remnant error</em> model defines the properties of the structural error of the rating curve.</li>
					<li>The <em>stage series</em> is the time series of water levels measured continuously at the hydrometric station.</li>
					<li>The <em>rating curve</em> is the stage-discharge relationship estimated from a hydraulic configuration, a set of gaugings and a 
					remnant error model.</li>
					<li>The <em>flow series</em> is the time series of discharge calculated from a stage series and a rating curve.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			The first four items in the above list are input data for the computations done by BaRatinAGE, and must therefore be specified by
			the user. In contrast, objects <em>rating curve</em> and <em>flow series</em> represent the results of BaRatinAGE computations.
			They can be exported in various formats.
