			<h1>Creating a flow series</h1>
			<p>You can create a new flow series in several ways:
				<ul>
					<li>via the Flow series...Add menu;</li> 
					<li>via the Ctrl+Y shortcut;</li> 
					<li>by making a right click on the node "Flow series" in the xplorer tree;</li> 
					<li>by clicking the button  
					<img src="img/Hydro_icon.png",alt="Hydro_icon",id="Hydro_icon", align="middle"> 
					in the tool bar.</li> 
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>You will be asked to name this new flow series, and you can enter a description.
			To specify the properties of the flow series you have to select:
				<ul>
					<li>A stage series;</li> 
					<li>A rating curve.</li> 
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>You are now ready to start the computation of the flow series, by clicking on the Run button.
			After the computation, the panel is updated as follows: </p>
			<p align="center"><img src="img/FlowSeries.png",alt="FlowSeries",id="FlowSeries"></p>
			<p>Note 1: The computing time for this step can be important, and it is mainly governed by
			the number of time steps contained in the stage series. As an order of magnitude,
			a computing time of about a minute is expected for a stage series containing 10,000 time steps. This is due
			to the method used by BaRatinAGE for estimating uncertainties. Indeed, to compute
			the uncertainty intervals around the flow series, several hundreds of flow series
			are actually computed by propagating both stage series uncertainties and 
			the rating curve uncertainties (spaghetti approach). For more details on this computation,
			you can refer to <a href="img/FlowSeriesComputation.pdf">this document</a>.</p>
			<p>Note 2:  To save memory and computational time, by default streamflow ensembles are not saved.
			If you wish to save the streamflow ensembles, go to Options...Save Options, select "yes", 
			apply and restart BaRatinAGE. From now on, the ensembles will be saved in the bar.zip file 
			each time you compute a discharge series within BaRatinAGE. 
			You'll find them in the subfolder "Hydrograph", with names like spagH.txt (uncertainty due to stage errors alone), 
			spagHParam.txt (stage errors + uncertainty in rating curve parameters), 
			spagTotal.txt (stage errors + uncertainty in rating curve parameters + remnant errors). 
			Be careful though: the created files might be very large, which might slow down opening/saving of the bar.zip file.</p>
			

			<h1>Graphics</h1>
			<p>By zooming in the graphic panel, several uncertainty intervals appear around
			the computed flow series, as shown below:</p>
			<p align="center"><img src="img/FlowSeries_zoom.png",alt="FlowSeries_zoom",id="FlowSeries_zoom"></p>
			<p>The elements of this chart should be interpreted like this:
			<ul>
			<li>The black curve is the flow series computed by propagating the stage series
			(without uncertainty) through the maxpost rating curve (without uncertainty);</li>
			<li>The yellow interval represents the uncertainty induced by the stage series only:
			the stage series uncertainty is propagated through the rating curve maxpost (without uncertainty);</li>
			<li>The light red interval represents the uncertainty induced by both the stage series and
			the parameters of the rating curve:
			the stage series uncertainty is propagated using a large number of rating curves,
			whose parameters vary according to the MCMC simulations done when estimating the
			rating curve;</li>
			<li> The dark red interval is the total uncertainty: in addition to the two sources
			of uncertainty described above, the uncertainty induced by the remnant error is added.</li>
			</ul>
			The uncertainty decomposition presented in this chart is rich in information: for example in the 
			plot shown above, the uncertainty related to the stage series (yellow) is low. We also observe
			that parametric uncertainty (light red) is dominant over 100 m<sup>3</sup>/s,
			but it becomes negligible for lower flows. This suggests an opportunity to decrease
			the uncertainty of the flow series by gauging in priority flows above
			100 m<sup>3</sup>/s (and indeed, getting back to the rating curve, it is observed there is no
			gaugings between 100 m<sup>3</sup>/s and 250 m<sup>3</sup>/s,
			and parametric uncertainty is particularly high in that range).</p>
