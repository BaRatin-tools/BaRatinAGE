			<h1>Using the content of a .bar.zip file</h1>
			<p>You may want to reuse the results of BaRatinAGE with your own tools: for example,
			get the parameters simulated by MCMC in your favorite spreadsheet to compare
			with your own calculations, or to make your own graphics, etc.
			For this you can use the .bar.zip file created to save the study. Indeed, this file
			is in fact nothing more than a zip file that contains all the information generated by BaRatinAGE,
			as plain text files.
			<p>For example, use your favorite Zip application to unzip the file named Sauze.bar.zip
			in the example directory. You then get a folder structure that exactly follows
			the structure of objects in BaRatinAGE. Looking through these files, you can then retrieve
			raw text files of interest, and process them as you see fit.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, the documentation of these raw files is rudimental so far.
			We will improve the documentation in future releases of BaratinAGE (with more
			explicit headers in the files, and a specific help). Meanwhile, you
			can send an email to the BaRatinAGE development team if you want to know more
			about these files.</p>
			
			<h1>Controlling the BaRatin.exe executable</h1>
			<p>BaRatinAGE works by controlling the BaRatin.exe executable,
			which performs all the computations, and which is located in the "exe" subdirectory
			of the BaRatinAGE installation folder. Controlling this executable is entirely done
			by handling a few configuration files that are in practice
			simple text files. This means that you can control
			the BaRatin.exe executable directly if you wish, bypassing the BaRatinAGE interface. This
			may be useful for example if you use a programming language and want to
			perform BaRatin computations directly in some of your programs.</p>
			<p>A copy of the configuration files created in the last computation done by BaRatinAGE
			can be recovered in the "recycle" subdirectory of the BaRatinAGE installation folder.
			Unfortunately, as for the .bar.zip file, the documentation for these configuration files is
			for the moment nonexistent. We will prepare special support in future versions of BaRatinAGE,
			but in the meantime you can send an email to the development team of BaRatinAGE
			if you want to learn more.</p>
