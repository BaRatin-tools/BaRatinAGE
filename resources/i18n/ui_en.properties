# Important notes:
# - you need to escape single quote using the symbole ' twice 
#   e.g. => It''s about time
# - translation can have arguments in between urly braquets {} with a number
#   within specifying the index of the arguments (since you can have mulitple arguments)
#   e.g. => Your name is {0} and you are {1} years old.
